        <p>This perennial Filipino favorite usually starts with a base of oxtails, beef stew cuts, pork hocks or tripe. Traditionally, the choice meat is simmered for hours to desired tenderness and and along with a variety of vegetables such as banana heart, long beans and eggplant, it's pulled together into a stew with ground peanuts for flavor, toasted ground rice for thickening  and annatto for coloring. Because of the dish's very involved cooking process, it is usually reserved for special occasions but by using convenient rice flour and peanut butter, it is simplified enough to be everyday dinner-friendly. </p>
